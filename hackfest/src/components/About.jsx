            <p>At AGRIGO, we are transforming the way agricultural waste is perceived and utilized. Founded by a passionate team—Sujan S, Shishir D, Shubham Raikar, and Shodhan Shetty—our mission is to bridge the gap between farmers and industries through an innovative digital marketplace.</p>

<p>We believe that agricultural waste is not just a by-product—it's an untapped resource. AGRIGO empowers farmers to list their agricultural waste, enabling industries to source it directly and sustainably. This not only provides farmers with a new income stream but also ensures a reliable supply chain for bio-based industries.</p>

<p>Our platform offers real-time updates on government schemes, market demand, and sustainable farming practices, ensuring that every stakeholder is informed and empowered. By promoting circular economy principles and enabling efficient waste management, we are contributing to a cleaner environment and a greener future.
</p>
<p>AGRIGO delivers a seamless and secure user experience. Whether you're a farmer, buyer, or eco-conscious partner, join us and be part of the green revolution.
</p>
<p>
Together, let’s turn waste into wealth.</p>
